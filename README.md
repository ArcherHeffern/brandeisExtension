# brandeisExtension

A wise man once said, "If your smart enough to navigate a schools website, you're smart enough to go there." However, in light of Brandeis moving down from tier 1 to tier 2 for research, I decided we should change the website accordingly. Thats why I decided to create an extension to make the site easier to use and improve the general look and feel. Some plans for the site beside general layout include fixing workday to have a back button, and making the site able to be modded.
